# Tower-of-Hanoi-Puzzle-Recursion-Python-Project
### About This Repository
I independently completed freeCodeCampâ€™s [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) certification, to invest in my scientific computing skills with Python. This repository contains my independent problem-solving work, as part of the seventh project in this curriculum. I devised a script for this ([Tower-of-Hanoi.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Tower-of-Hanoi-Puzzle-Recursion-Python-Project/blob/main/Tower-of-Hanoi.py)), which applied lambda functions in Python, to produce an expense tracker program. This program may be run by cloning this repository, and was designed to track user expenses by prompting them for an input between one and five. The expense tracking functionality of this interface is provided in further detail by the flow diagram below. The project .py file includes in-depth problem solving approaches used to write this program and my project [Tower of Hanoi Problem Solving Thought Process Notes.txt](https://github.com/franpanteli/Tower-of-Hanoi-Puzzle-Recursion-Python-Project/blob/main/Tower%20of%20Hanoi%20Problem%20Solving%20Thought%20Process%20Notes.txt) Notes contain more information regarding its theory. This enabled me to invest in my function writing skills with Python and marked the successful completion of the seventh project in the certification.
