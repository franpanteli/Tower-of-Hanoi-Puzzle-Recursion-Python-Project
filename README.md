# Tower-of-Hanoi-Puzzle-Recursion-Python-Project
### About This Repository
I independently completed freeCodeCampâ€™s [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) certification, to invest in my scientific computing skills with Python. This repository contains my independent problem-solving work, as part of the seventh project in this curriculum. I devised two scripts for this ([Tower-of-Hanoi-iterative-approach.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Tower-of-Hanoi-Puzzle-Recursion-Python-Project/blob/main/Tower-of-Hanoi-iterative-approach.py) and [Tower-of-Hanoi-recursive-approach.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Tower-of-Hanoi-Puzzle-Recursion-Python-Project/blob/main/Tower-of-Hanoi-recursive-approach.py)), which respectively applied iterative and recursive approaches to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. This puzzle involved three rods and `n` disks, each represented by a Python dictionary. These disks were to be moved from the source to the target rods in the puzzle, following rules which were programmed into the `move()` function that operated on them. The project .py files include in-depth problem solving approaches used to write the program and my project [problem solving notes](https://github.com/franpanteli/Tower-of-Hanoi-Puzzle-Recursion-Python-Project/blob/main/Tower%20of%20Hanoi%20Problem%20Solving%20Thought%20Process%20Notes.txt) contain more information regarding its theory. This enabled me to invest in my recursive expression knowledge with Python and marked the successful completion of the seventh project in the certification.
